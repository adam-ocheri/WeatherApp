In my docker compose file, how can I add my env file to be loaded in the container?

I'll help you understand how to add your env file to be loaded in the Docker container. Let me first examine your current docker-compose.yml file to see the current configuration.


I can see your current docker-compose.yml file. To load an environment file in your Docker container, you have a couple of options:

## Option 1: Using `env_file` directive (Recommended)

Add an `env_file` directive to your service to load environment variables from a file:

```yaml
services:
  integrations-api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    env_file:
      - .env  # or whatever your env file is named
    restart: unless-stopped
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
```

## Option 2: Using `environment` with file reference

You can also use the `environment` directive with file references:

```yaml
services:
  integrations-api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    environment:
      - ENV_FILE=/app/.env
    restart: unless-stopped
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
```

## Option 3: Multiple env files

If you have multiple environment files, you can specify them as a list:

```yaml
services:
  integrations-api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    env_file:
      - .env
      - .env.local
      - .env.production
    restart: unless-stopped
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
```

## Important Notes:

1. **File location**: The env file should be in the same directory as your docker-compose.yml file, or you can specify a relative path.

2. **File format**: Your .env file should follow the standard format:
   ```
   VARIABLE_NAME=value
   ANOTHER_VARIABLE=another_value
   ```

3. **Security**: Be careful not to commit sensitive environment files to version control. Consider using `.env.example` for templates.

The `env_file` directive (Option 1) is the most straightforward and commonly used approach. It will automatically load all environment variables from the specified file into your container.

Would you like me to help you with anything else regarding the environment configuration?

```yaml
services:
  integrations-api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    env_file:
      - .env  # or whatever your env file is named
    restart: unless-stopped
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
```

```yaml
services:
  integrations-api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    environment:
      - ENV_FILE=/app/.env
    restart: unless-stopped
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
```

```yaml
services:
  integrations-api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    env_file:
      - .env
      - .env.local
      - .env.production
    restart: unless-stopped
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
```

```plaintext
   VARIABLE_NAME=value
   ANOTHER_VARIABLE=another_value
```
